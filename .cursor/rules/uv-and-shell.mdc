## Shell and Tooling Conventions

- **Use uv**: Run Python tools with `uv`. Prefer `uvx` for CLIs and `uv run` for scripts.
  - Ruff format: 
    ```bash
    uvx ruff format .
    ```
  - Ruff autofix and check:
    ```bash
    uvx ruff check --fix .
    uvx ruff check .
    ```

- **Do not change directories**: The working directory is already the project root. Avoid `cd`.

- **Paths**: Prefer absolute paths when invoking tools and editing files.

- **Non-interactive defaults**: Pass non-interactive flags when needed. If a command would use a pager, append `| cat`.

- **Background jobs**: For long-running commands, run them in the background instead of blocking the shell.
