## Python Exception Handling Rules

- Never catch base exceptions:
  - Do not use `except Exception:`
  - Do not use `except BaseException:`

- Do not add try/except blocks unless explicitly instructed by the user for a specific case.

- If explicitly instructed to catch exceptions:
  - Catch the most specific exception type(s) only
  - Keep the try block as small as possible
  - Do not silently swallow errors (no bare `except:` or `pass`-only handlers)
  - Prefer re-raising with context (`raise` or `raise NewError from e`) if appropriate

- Prefer guard checks and letting exceptions propagate naturally over blanket handling.
